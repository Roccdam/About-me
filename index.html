        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I am Damola, A frontend developer. I came across frontend development
            while doing a research on the most in-demand tech skills
            in 2021. The journey has not been so easy for me.
            There was a time I stopped learning due to lack of motivation and
            I was literally on the verge of giving up but the consciousness of "I cannot
            be broke got me back on the track"
        </p>
